Even if you don’t have an IT background. All you need is confidence and communication skills for the training sessions you will be doing, like not being afraid to ask questions to customers, for example, or if something is unclear, to speak up. Tech skills will come in handy as you will need to be able to fix any errors in service installations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat's the coolest thing about your job?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe coolest thing I would say is that the team is very involved with one another. Every morning, sharp 9am, we have a meeting where everyone gets to speak and share what happened the day before. Everyone is very cooperative and contributes to any ideas\u002Fsolutions they have. Another cool thing is that I learned to work with a new online system.

I learned that when you do focus on your career, you will be able to get somewhere. If you lose confidence, we can’t do anything. I noticed it is hard to get a job in Australia as employers ask for experience, which is frustrating. How will you get experience if no one offers you the chance to get any? I learned after finishing university that you have to believe in yourself and keep going. An internship is a very valuable thing to do as I already improved a lot in the technology field.

I noticed it is hard to get a job in Australia as employers ask for experience, which is frustrating. How will you get experience if no one offers you the chance to get any?
