Me? I didn’t study anything related to IT or banking. One night, spurred on by a moment of confidence I thought, why not just apply and see how I go; after all, what did I have to lose? Not having to submit a resume and instead, play a few games (yes, this really is the application process!), was definitely an incentive to apply.\u003Cbr\u002F\u003ELittle did I know, a soon-to-be journalism grad was about to be accepted as a Technology Graduate for ANZ. I would like to share with you, four truth bombs I came upon since I joined the program.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E#1. Don’t dull down your past experiences, they make you unique\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the first things I learnt applying for a graduate position at ANZ (and being in the role), is to not discount your past experience as this is ultimately what makes us all unique! For ANZ, the broader experiences that shape who we are, are just as important as “technical skills” when they consider whom to recruit. Before starting at ANZ, I’d worked many different jobs – often juggling two at a time. As a teenager I coached and umpired netball, before securing my first ‘real’ job at Kmart Australia where I worked my way up to become a Duty Manager. I did lots of other things too: working with students with physical and learning difficulties, waitressing at my parent’s café, being active in sports and at university, and I also did a few internships. The purpose of me telling you all of this, is to emphasise that these experiences (all very different), teach us how to be a team player, a leader, how to multi-task, be resilient – the list goes on. And these skills have helped me adapt to the corporate world and the New Ways of Working model that ANZ has adopted in recent years. So, don’t disregard the things you have done previously as these really are what set you apart!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-profiles\"\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-avatar\"\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-avatar-img\"\u003E\u003Cimg height=\"148\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fau.cdn.gradconnection.com\u002Fmedia\u002Fuploads\u002F3f15135a9feb4ac.png\" title=\"Graduate Profile\" width=\"148\"\u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-name\"\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ERenae Bice\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"graduate-title\"\u003E2020 Agribusiness Graduate\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-questions\"\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESince graduating university, I was lucky enough to be a part of the 2020 ANZ Agribusiness Graduate program. To be honest, if you asked me when I left school or at the start of university where I would be at the end of my degree, I never would have thought I would be working in a bank. I am extremely passionate about the Australian Agriculture Industry and while I was attending the annual Australia Dairy Conference, I was lucky to enough to meet like-minded people who introduced me to a fellow ANZ Agribusiness manager and graduate at the time who encouraged me to apply for the program.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI saw huge benefit being able to broaden my agribusiness knowledge, service Agri customers as well as enhance my knowledge into different agriculture industries through the rotations.  A few months later, I received a call offering me a position that I could not turn down. In my first rotation I was placed in Gippsland, VIC, which was predominantly dairy based and due to COVID saw myself working back at home on the farm until I relocated to the Southern Highlands, for my second rotation which was refreshing starting back in the office and gaining insight into both agribusiness and commercial clients and finishing the program with my final rotation located in South West Vic. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf someone had told me at the beginning of the year that I would be working from home more than in the office, I would have told them they’re joking. Starting a career in a pandemic was a challenging experience but I am amazed of how technology has enabled everyone to adapt and continue to work, learn and be more resilient.  The work I complete changes day to day which is one thing I love about being an Agribusiness Graduate. One day you could be out visiting clients (which is definitely a highlight of the job) and being able to see first-hand their businesses and how we can make a positive impact, to the next day, sitting in front of the computer preparing documents, assessing transactions with your manager, analysing financials and of course checking emails. I am lucky to be in a position where I'm able to connect with farmers on a daily basis and being able to roll off the Graduate program into a position to do so excites me. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-profiles\"\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-avatar\"\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-avatar-img\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.cdn.gradconnection.com\u002Fuploads\u002F2cfcbdc50db33ebbf11ed79973a31167.jpg\" title=\"Graduate Profile\" width=\"200\"\u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-name\"\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ELorraine Ohk\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"graduate-title\"\u003EANZx Graduate\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-questions\"\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy background - and my passion - is ancient history and psychology.

I really appreciated that passion and how inclusive they were of all skills and backgrounds.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI wasn’t sure how my degree would be relevant to a career in banking. But upon reflection, my chosen majors reflected a shared interest in the discourse surrounding human nature and human relationships. Because banking and financial technology touch every part of society, I found I was able to engage with the work early on, while slowly filling in any technical knowledge gaps over time. This was a common experience among all the graduates, who had also come with a diverse set of experiences and expertise.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJoining ANZ as a Graduate, I’ve spent a lot of my time in the ANZx team – working on building and delivering a new banking app, called ANZ Plus.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my role, about half the time I’m thinking from the perspective of the end user, and how our application can help customers.

For ANZ, the broader experiences that shape who we are, are just as important as “technical skills” when they consider whom to recruit. Before starting at ANZ, I’d worked many different jobs – often juggling two at a time. As a teenager I coached and umpired netball, before securing my first ‘real’ job at Kmart Australia where I worked my way up to become a Duty Manager. I did lots of other things too: working with students with physical and learning difficulties, waitressing at my parent’s café, being active in sports and at university, and I also did a few internships. The purpose of me telling you all of this, is to emphasise that these experiences (all very different), teach us how to be a team player, a leader, how to multi-task, be resilient – the list goes on. And these skills have helped me adapt to the corporate world and the New Ways of Working model that ANZ has adopted in recent years.

To be honest, if you asked me when I left school or at the start of university where I would be at the end of my degree, I never would have thought I would be working in a bank. I am extremely passionate about the Australian Agriculture Industry and while I was attending the annual Australia Dairy Conference, I was lucky to enough to meet like-minded people who introduced me to a fellow ANZ Agribusiness manager and graduate at the time who encouraged me to apply for the program.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI saw huge benefit being able to broaden my agribusiness knowledge, service Agri customers as well as enhance my knowledge into different agriculture industries through the rotations.  A few months later, I received a call offering me a position that I could not turn down.

One day you could be out visiting clients (which is definitely a highlight of the job) and being able to see first-hand their businesses and how we can make a positive impact, to the next day, sitting in front of the computer preparing documents, assessing transactions with your manager, analysing financials and of course checking emails.

Don’t dull down your past experiences, they make you unique\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the first things I learnt applying for a graduate position at ANZ (and being in the role), is to not discount your past experience as this is ultimately what makes us all unique! For ANZ, the broader experiences that shape who we are, are just as important as “technical skills” when they consider whom to recruit. Before starting at ANZ, I’d worked many different jobs – often juggling two at a time. As a teenager I coached and umpired netball, before securing my first ‘real’ job at Kmart Australia where I worked my way up to become a Duty Manager. I did lots of other things too: working with students with physical and learning difficulties, waitressing at my parent’s café, being active in sports and at university, and I also did a few internships. The purpose of me telling you all of this, is to emphasise that these experiences (all very different), teach us how to be a team player, a leader, how to multi-task, be resilient – the list goes on. And these skills have helped me adapt to the corporate world and the New Ways of Working model that ANZ has adopted in recent years. So, don’t disregard the things you have done previously as these really are what set you apart!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-profiles\"\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-avatar\"\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-avatar-img\"\u003E\u003Cimg height=\"148\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fau.cdn.gradconnection.com\u002Fmedia\u002Fuploads\u002F3f15135a9feb4ac.png\" title=\"Graduate Profile\" width=\"148\"\u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-name\"\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ERenae Bice\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"graduate-title\"\u003E2020 Agribusiness Graduate\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-questions\"\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESince graduating university, I was lucky enough to be a part of the 2020 ANZ Agribusiness Graduate program. To be honest, if you asked me when I left school or at the start of university where I would be at the end of my degree, I never would have thought I would be working in a bank. I am extremely passionate about the Australian Agriculture Industry and while I was attending the annual Australia Dairy Conference, I was lucky to enough to meet like-minded people who introduced me to a fellow ANZ Agribusiness manager and graduate at the time who encouraged me to apply for the program.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI saw huge benefit being able to broaden my agribusiness knowledge, service Agri customers as well as enhance my knowledge into different agriculture industries through the rotations.  A few months later, I received a call offering me a position that I could not turn down. In my first rotation I was placed in Gippsland, VIC, which was predominantly dairy based and due to COVID saw myself working back at home on the farm until I relocated to the Southern Highlands, for my second rotation which was refreshing starting back in the office and gaining insight into both agribusiness and commercial clients and finishing the program with my final rotation located in South West Vic. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf someone had told me at the beginning of the year that I would be working from home more than in the office, I would have told them they’re joking. Starting a career in a pandemic was a challenging experience but I am amazed of how technology has enabled everyone to adapt and continue to work, learn and be more resilient.  The work I complete changes day to day which is one thing I love about being an Agribusiness Graduate. One day you could be out visiting clients (which is definitely a highlight of the job) and being able to see first-hand their businesses and how we can make a positive impact, to the next day, sitting in front of the computer preparing documents, assessing transactions with your manager, analysing financials and of course checking emails. I am lucky to be in a position where I'm able to connect with farmers on a daily basis and being able to roll off the Graduate program into a position to do so excites me. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-profiles\"\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-avatar\"\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-avatar-img\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.cdn.gradconnection.com\u002Fuploads\u002F2cfcbdc50db33ebbf11ed79973a31167.jpg\" title=\"Graduate Profile\" width=\"200\"\u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-name\"\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ELorraine Ohk\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"graduate-title\"\u003EANZx Graduate\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-questions\"\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy background - and my passion - is ancient history and psychology.

But upon reflection, my chosen majors reflected a shared interest in the discourse surrounding human nature and human relationships. Because banking and financial technology touch every part of society, I found I was able to engage with the work early on, while slowly filling in any technical knowledge gaps over time. This was a common experience among all the graduates, who had also come with a diverse set of experiences and expertise.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJoining ANZ as a Graduate, I’ve spent a lot of my time in the ANZx team – working on building and delivering a new banking app, called ANZ Plus.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my role, about half the time I’m thinking from the perspective of the end user, and how our application can help customers.
