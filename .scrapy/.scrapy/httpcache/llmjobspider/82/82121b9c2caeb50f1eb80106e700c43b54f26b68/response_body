We advise candidates to use the 'STAR' method to answer questions relating to their prior experience. We encourage you to be 'YOU' and display your 'Always Day 1' attitude during the interviews. TikTok highly values authenticity and unique thought.

The interview is a great chance for you to learn more about TikTok and the person you're speaking with. You can ask your interviewer questions about his or her role and experiences at TikTok, as well as any other information you would like to know.

You are encouraged to think out loud to allow the interviewer to understand your problem-solving approach. We have noticed that strong candidates tend to ask relevant questions before writing the code, diagram the problem, validate their assumptions, and check their work constantly without being prompted. While solving a problem, pay keen attention to the efficiency of your solution to make sure it's not unnecessarily complicated.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EBe agile and receptive to feedback\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn a technical interview, you are expected to think on your feet.

Then, I dive into my development work, which could involve anything such as data collection, data analysis, model training, service deployment, and maintenance. At lunch, I enjoy a (free!) meal with my colleagues, and sometimes I even take a quick power nap to recharge. Each week, we have a team meeting to share progress and plan for the week ahead.
