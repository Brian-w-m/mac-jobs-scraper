Given my educational background and experience with and passion for clients, I was recommended the CIB stream.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat was the highlight of your graduate experience?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe freedom to decide what you do and who you meet was my highlight. The program allowed me to undertake a secondment as well as engage in the graduate-led committee and other opportunities. I found that people I worked with, even those much more senior to me, often made themselves very available to catch up and share their advice and career reflections. Learnings from these catch-ups still guide my career decision making today. Overall, the program was what I chose to make of it.  \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWas there anything about that graduate program that exceeded your expectations?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe social side of the program exceeded my expectations. I still keep in touch with many grads from my cohort, regularly seeing them outside of work hours and we’ve continued the netball team we established during the program into our 7th or 8th season now.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ECan you tell us about the teams that you completed your rotations in?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI rotated in Corporate Finance (Corporate Property CME) and Markets (Structured Products &amp; Advisory). I also undertook secondments in Energy &amp; Utilities CME and Group Development. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat role are you in now?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EClimate Strategy\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow do you feel the graduate program has set you up for your current role \u002F career at NAB?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe grad program highlighted which skills came naturally to me and which ones didn’t. Equally, it showed me which areas I wanted to develop further. Unlike a lot of my peers, I didn’t end up in a team that I rotated in, but I feel that my secondments shaped the decision. I found a passion for climate and sustainability work while seconding in the Energy &amp; Utilities CME team and also enjoyed the strategy and consulting skillset offered in Group Development. I feel that the role I ended up in combines these passions, both of which I didn’t completely know I had prior to the program.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat advice do you have for the next graduates on how to make the most of their graduate program?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeak to a lot of people. Look at the org chart and find teams that sound interesting, find names of people in the teams and send an email. Some people won’t get back to you but the ones that do will be worth it.  Also, treat all roles and experiences, good and bad, as a positive or learning opportunity. Finding out what you don’t enjoy or don’t want to pursue is equally valuable as finding out what you do. It’s the best time in your career to try something and find out it’s not for you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EYou were the Treasurer on the 2022 Grad Committee. Could you tell us about why you applied for this position and also how this complemented your graduate program?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI applied for this position as I saw it as an opportunity to build on my leadership abilities while also being very involved in each of the initiatives ran by the grad committee. The Treasurer is responsible for managing the graduate bank accounts (collecting money from grads and making payments), preparing meeting materials, and working with the Chairs of the committee to run meetings and assist sub-committees with their initiatives. This role improved my organisation, leadership, and presentation skills but the biggest way it complemented my graduate program was by establishing a strong network of peers with whom I was able to work with.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EYou were also successful in being appointed The Banking &amp; Financial Services Oath ambassador. Can you please tell us about your role as ambassador and what you learnt from this experience.\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Banking and Financial Services Oath (BFSO) is an initiative that seeks to strengthen the ethical standards of financial services through the empowerment of individuals making a personal commitment of integrity.  \u003Cbr\u002F\u003EAs an ambassador, I worked with my fellow ambassadors, who were also young people early in their banking and finance careers from a range of institutions, on a project designed to increase the ethical standards of our industry. For us, that was to create a series of videos showcasing the lived experiences of indigenous people, migrant Australians, and young women in navigating the Australian financial sector. These videos were rolled out into training programs across industry. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn a personal level, it was fantastic to build a network of likeminded individuals from other parts of the industry, enabling me to broaden my view of how banks and other financial services work together and separately. Additionally, being able to choose a project we were personally passionate about and see it through end-to-end, including the impact of it, was extremely rewarding.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EIs there anything that you would like to add?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it helped to have a mindset during the program of ‘everyone here knows something I don’t’. You may meet people on the program that have very different interests or career goals but ultimately every connection could be valuable in the long-run.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-profiles\"\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-avatar\"\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-avatar-img\"\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\"\" height=\"733\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.cdn.gradconnection.com\u002Fuploads\u002F76b8d45dafb5123d9c4005bac1283d98.png\" width=\"735\"\u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-name\"\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EMeet Hannah\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp class=\"graduate-title\"\u003E2022 Business Banking Graduate – Brisbane\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003C\u002Fdiv\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\"graduate-questions\"\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat did you study &amp; where?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E I studied a Bachelor of Design Computing at the University Sydney. It’s essentially a degree that specialises in UX\u002FUI Design and programming. A bit different to banking! \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat drew you to the NAB Graduate program?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI liked the concept of doing 5 rotations over 18 months rather than being locked in straight away. Given that I didn’t come from a banking background being able to have this range of experiences really appealed to me. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow did you decide which stream to apply for?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E In all honesty, the biggest factor for me was that Business Banking had a stream in Brisbane! I am a born and bred Queenslander, so being able to move back closer to my family after Uni was important to me. However, I definitely don’t regret my choice and am still happily working in the Business Bank. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat was the highlight of your graduate experience?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETruly, there are too many to count. I particularly enjoyed my secondment, where I travelled back to Sydney for a month to join ubank’s UX\u002FUI Design team. Being able to work in the field I studied was an awesome experience, and I particularly enjoyed the free snack bar in the ubank office. However, it also allowed me to solidify the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed Business Banking, and wanted to pursue a career in this field rather than UX\u002FUI Design. I also developed a strong friendship with my fellow Brisbane grad Holly, and we are still great friends to this day. I recently loaned her some crochet hooks as she is starting to learn, and I am looking forward to attending her cat’s 20th birthday party later this month! \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWas there anything about that graduate program that exceeded your expectations?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe support I received from everyone around me was really amazing – I expected to struggle due to not coming from a banking\u002Fcommerce background, but everyone was happy to support me learning and appreciated my unique perspective. I was especially wowed by the support I received from different rotation leaders when organising my secondment at ubank – the leaders went above and beyond to help me organise this rotation in a completely different sector, even though it meant I would be leaving their team! \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ECan you tell us about the teams that you completed your rotations in?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI completed rotations in:\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ECLS (Customer Lending Solutions), structuring new lending deals and writing credit applications to support our Business Bankers\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EBDSB (Business Direct &amp; Small Business), working with the Small Business Bankers on lending deals and day to day customer management\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EUbank (Secondment, UX\u002FUI Design), working on projects such as ubank’s new Home Loan interface on the website and app\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERA (Relationship Associate), working in alignment with Business Bankers to service day to day customer transactional enquiries\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EMajor Initiatives, working on the beginning of a project to replace our current Equipment Finance competition.

I am able to field questions from my colleagues about lending and other areas that they aren’t familiar with, thanks to my time in all of these other teams. It also allowed me to grow significantly in my personal and professional life, and I have built a strong network of people I have met throughout my rotations who are excited to help me throughout my career. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat advice do you have for the next graduates on how to make the most of their graduate program? \u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EDon’t be afraid of pulling the ‘grad card’ – a lot of my connections and experiences am from putting my imposter syndrome aside, and reaching out to people far more senior than me.

In my final year of study, I started exploring options post-degree. For me it was a choice between taking the next step within NAB (likely to a Business Banking role of some sort) or doing the Graduate Program. Ultimately, I was drawn to the breadth of experience that the grad program offered, especially so early in my career. I realised that I couldn’t clearly picture where I wanted to be in my career in 3-5 years and for that reason saw a lot of benefit in a program that lets you rotate across teams and see far more than you would in any other role.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow did you decide which stream to apply for?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI spoke with mentors, predominantly my Personal Bank people leader at the time, about what the program looked like and what each stream offered.

Given my educational background and experience with and passion for clients, I was recommended the CIB stream.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat was the highlight of your graduate experience?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe freedom to decide what you do and who you meet was my highlight.

Equally, it showed me which areas I wanted to develop further. Unlike a lot of my peers, I didn’t end up in a team that I rotated in, but I feel that my secondments shaped the decision. I found a passion for climate and sustainability work while seconding in the Energy &amp; Utilities CME team and also enjoyed the strategy and consulting skillset offered in Group Development. I feel that the role I ended up in combines these passions, both of which I didn’t completely know I had prior to the program.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat advice do you have for the next graduates on how to make the most of their graduate program?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeak to a lot of people. Look at the org chart and find teams that sound interesting, find names of people in the teams and send an email. Some people won’t get back to you but the ones that do will be worth it.  Also, treat all roles and experiences, good and bad, as a positive or learning opportunity. Finding out what you don’t enjoy or don’t want to pursue is equally valuable as finding out what you do. It’s the best time in your career to try something and find out it’s not for you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EYou were the Treasurer on the 2022 Grad Committee.

The Treasurer is responsible for managing the graduate bank accounts (collecting money from grads and making payments), preparing meeting materials, and working with the Chairs of the committee to run meetings and assist sub-committees with their initiatives. This role improved my organisation, leadership, and presentation skills but the biggest way it complemented my graduate program was by establishing a strong network of peers with whom I was able to work with.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EYou were also successful in being appointed The Banking &amp; Financial Services Oath ambassador.

For us, that was to create a series of videos showcasing the lived experiences of indigenous people, migrant Australians, and young women in navigating the Australian financial sector. These videos were rolled out into training programs across industry. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn a personal level, it was fantastic to build a network of likeminded individuals from other parts of the industry, enabling me to broaden my view of how banks and other financial services work together and separately. Additionally, being able to choose a project we were personally passionate about and see it through end-to-end, including the impact of it, was extremely rewarding.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EIs there anything that you would like to add?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it helped to have a mindset during the program of ‘everyone here knows something I don’t’.

Being able to work in the field I studied was an awesome experience, and I particularly enjoyed the free snack bar in the ubank office. However, it also allowed me to solidify the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed Business Banking, and wanted to pursue a career in this field rather than UX\u002FUI Design. I also developed a strong friendship with my fellow Brisbane grad Holly, and we are still great friends to this day. I recently loaned her some crochet hooks as she is starting to learn, and I am looking forward to attending her cat’s 20th birthday party later this month! \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWas there anything about that graduate program that exceeded your expectations?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe support I received from everyone around me was really amazing – I expected to struggle due to not coming from a banking\u002Fcommerce background, but everyone was happy to support me learning and appreciated my unique perspective.

Firstly, the ability to do different rotations. When comparing to other graduate programs where I needed to know exactly what I was interested in beforehand, it was nice to know that I could learn the ropes in multiple areas before rolling off somewhere I enjoyed. Secondly, the comfort of working at an organisation that I was intimately aware of the product as banking is something we use every day so knew I didn’t need to learn much to understand how to make an impact.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow did you decide which stream to apply for?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI had studied a bit of data analytics in university and really enjoyed it, but wanted to get more hands on experience, especially in a more technical capacity.

I’ve made some lifelong friends as part of the grad experience and still regularly see them to play netball and catch up socially. It’s really unique to have work colleagues that you never work directly with that are experiencing something really similar to you and to have connections in so many places around such a large organisation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWas there anything about that graduate program that exceeded your expectations?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy secondment definitely exceeded my expectations.

I have more awareness of so much going on around NAB because I helped contribute to so many projects through my time in different teams. It helps me with my current role because I sometimes have a lot more context than other people.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat advice do you have for the next graduates on how to make the most of their graduate program?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s a time of discovery in the grad program – time to discover what full time work is like, time to discover what elements of work you enjoy and don’t, time to discover what is important to you in a team. It’s such a perfect time to change teams, figure out your passions and find your place at NAB\u002Fin your career. If you’re not enjoying something, find another team that you will. The flexibility in the grad program is there so that you can be set up for success.

In my final year of study, I started exploring options post-degree. For me it was a choice between taking the next step within NAB (likely to a Business Banking role of some sort) or doing the Graduate Program. Ultimately, I was drawn to the breadth of experience that the grad program offered, especially so early in my career. I realised that I couldn’t clearly picture where I wanted to be in my career in 3-5 years and for that reason saw a lot of benefit in a program that lets you rotate across teams and see far more than you would in any other role.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EHow did you decide which stream to apply for?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI spoke with mentors, predominantly my Personal Bank people leader at the time, about what the program looked like and what each stream offered. They told me about what each frontline division offered (PB, BPB, CIB) along with the roles in enabling functions (Finance, Strategy, Tech etc.). Given my educational background and experience with and passion for clients, I was recommended the CIB stream.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat was the highlight of your graduate experience?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe freedom to decide what you do and who you meet was my highlight. The program allowed me to undertake a secondment as well as engage in the graduate-led committee and other opportunities. I found that people I worked with, even those much more senior to me, often made themselves very available to catch up and share their advice and career reflections. Learnings from these catch-ups still guide my career decision making today. Overall, the program was what I chose to make of it.  \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWas there anything about that graduate program that exceeded your expectations?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe social side of the program exceeded my expectations. I still keep in touch with many grads from my cohort, regularly seeing them outside of work hours and we’ve continued the netball team we established during the program into our 7th or 8th season now.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ECan you tell us about the teams that you completed your rotations in?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI rotated in Corporate Finance (Corporate Property CME) and Markets (Structured Products & Advisory).

Equally, it showed me which areas I wanted to develop further. Unlike a lot of my peers, I didn’t end up in a team that I rotated in, but I feel that my secondments shaped the decision. I found a passion for climate and sustainability work while seconding in the Energy & Utilities CME team and also enjoyed the strategy and consulting skillset offered in Group Development. I feel that the role I ended up in combines these passions, both of which I didn’t completely know I had prior to the program.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat advice do you have for the next graduates on how to make the most of their graduate program?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESpeak to a lot of people. Look at the org chart and find teams that sound interesting, find names of people in the teams and send an email. Some people won’t get back to you but the ones that do will be worth it.  Also, treat all roles and experiences, good and bad, as a positive or learning opportunity. Finding out what you don’t enjoy or don’t want to pursue is equally valuable as finding out what you do. It’s the best time in your career to try something and find out it’s not for you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EYou were the Treasurer on the 2022 Grad Committee.

The Treasurer is responsible for managing the graduate bank accounts (collecting money from grads and making payments), preparing meeting materials, and working with the Chairs of the committee to run meetings and assist sub-committees with their initiatives. This role improved my organisation, leadership, and presentation skills but the biggest way it complemented my graduate program was by establishing a strong network of peers with whom I was able to work with.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EYou were also successful in being appointed The Banking & Financial Services Oath ambassador.

For us, that was to create a series of videos showcasing the lived experiences of indigenous people, migrant Australians, and young women in navigating the Australian financial sector. These videos were rolled out into training programs across industry. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn a personal level, it was fantastic to build a network of likeminded individuals from other parts of the industry, enabling me to broaden my view of how banks and other financial services work together and separately. Additionally, being able to choose a project we were personally passionate about and see it through end-to-end, including the impact of it, was extremely rewarding.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EIs there anything that you would like to add?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it helped to have a mindset during the program of ‘everyone here knows something I don’t’.

Being able to work in the field I studied was an awesome experience, and I particularly enjoyed the free snack bar in the ubank office. However, it also allowed me to solidify the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed Business Banking, and wanted to pursue a career in this field rather than UX\u002FUI Design. I also developed a strong friendship with my fellow Brisbane grad Holly, and we are still great friends to this day.
